# VESA-Mountable ESP32-S3 with VGA Output

![](Docs/IMG_1070.jpg)

## Overview

This project is a **VESA-mountable ESP32-S3** development board with **VGA output** — a unique and space-saving solution for embedded applications that benefit from graphical displays.

The core idea is simple: create a **microcontroller-based VGA device** that can be easily attached to the back of a monitor using a **VESA-compatible plate PCB**. This results in a clutter-free and elegant hardware setup, ideal for DIYers, educators, and tinkerers.

## Why It’s Cool

- **VGA from a microcontroller**: VGA video from the ESP32-S3 is no small feat.
- **Compact design**: Mounts directly behind your monitor using standard VESA mounting holes.
- **Open Hardware**: Schematics and PCB designs are fully available.

## Shoutout

This project wouldn’t be possible without the incredible work of **[BitLuni](https://github.com/bitluni)**, who developed the groundbreaking library that enables VGA output on the ESP32-S3.

## Project Files
